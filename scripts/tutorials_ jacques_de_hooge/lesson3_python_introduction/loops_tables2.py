'''
Requirements: 
- The program asks for the first 10 products of the first 10 multiplication tables in the natural order. 
- It does so by going through multiple rounds of questions.
- Whenever a particular question, e.g. 3 x 4 has been answered correctly for 3 consetuive times, it isn't asked again.  
- When there are no questions lest to ask, the program terminates. 

Test spec: 
- Temporary set both the nr of tables and the nr of lines per table to 3. 
- In the second round, answer all questions correctly exept 2 x 2 and 1 x 3. 
- Keep on answering  correctly until only the questions 2 x 2 and 1 x 3 remain.
- Anwer 2 x 2 correctly, but answer 1 x 3 wrongly.
- Keep answering 1 x 3 correctly (should be for 3 times) until the program terminates.
- Restore both the nr of tables and the nr of lines to 10. 
 
Design:
- As a scoreboard, use a list of lists (one sub-list per table) to hold the nr of successiver right answers for all tables. 
- If a question is answered correctly the score is incremented by 1, else it is reset to 0. 
- Before asking a question, check the scoreboard if it already has been anwsered correctly for three consecutive times. 
- In each round, remember if any question has been asked at all, if not the program terminates.
